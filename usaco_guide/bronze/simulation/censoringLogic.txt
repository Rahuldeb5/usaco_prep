Initial Logic:
Go thru each char of the string.
If substring(i, t.size()) == t, then add substr(0,i) and substr(i+t.size(), s.size()-1-i-t.size()) to a new temp string.
Assign s to temp string.
I = I-t.size()

Actual Logic:
Let us define censored as the final censored text.

We can iterate through every character of s, appending it to censored.
However, whenever we append a character we we need to check if censored ends with the censored word.
If it does, we remove it from censored by taking off the last few characters.

As a demonstration, let's try this on the example case where:

s = whatthemomooofun 
t = moo 

Our solution will loop through each character of s, appending it to censored until it becomes $\texttt{whatthemomoo}$, when it will cut off the last 3 characters since they equal t. This results in censored becoming whatthemo.
Right after this, censored becomes whatthemoo as the next letter in $s$ is $o$, so we omit the last 3 characters again and censored becomes whatthe.

After this, the check isn't triggered anymore, so we end up with whatthefun as our final word.
